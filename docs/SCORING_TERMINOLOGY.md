# Scoring Terminology

Crokinole scoring has a three-level hierarchy. Consistent terminology across all languages is critical.

## Scoring Hierarchy

| Level | English | Spanish | Catalan | Description |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **1. Round** | round | ronda | ronda | Single exchange of discs (0-2 points distributed) |
| **2. Game** | game | partida | partida | Play until target points reached (e.g., 7-3) |
| **3. Match** | match | encuentro | encontre | Set of games when using Pg format (e.g., 2-0 in games) |

## Example Flow
1. Player A wins a **round** 2-0 (scores 2 crokinole points)
2. After several rounds, Player A wins the **game** 7-3 (reached 7 points first)
3. If playing Pg2, Player A needs to win 2 **games** to win the **match**
4. Player A wins the **match** 2-0 (won 2 games, e.g., 7-3 and 8-4)

## Abbreviations

| Abbr | Spanish | English | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Pg** | Primero que gane | First to win | Games a player must win (Pg2 = first to win 2 games) |
| **p** | puntos | points | Game mode by points (7p = play to 7 points) |
| **r** | rondas | rounds | Game mode by rounds (4r = play 4 rounds) |

**Important**: We use "Pg" (not "Bo") because the concept is "first to win X games", not "best of X".
- Pg2 = First to win 2 games (not "Best of 3")

**Why "encuentro/encontre"?** In Spanish/Catalan, "partido" and "partida" sound too similar. "Encuentro/encontre" clearly differentiates the match level from the game level.
