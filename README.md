### Game Terminology & Structure
In Crokinole, understanding the game structure is important:

- **Round (Ronda)**: A single scoring exchange where points are tallied (can end 2-0 or 1-1). The hammer alternates automatically after each completed round.
- **Game (Partida)**: In points mode, multiple rounds played until one team reaches the "Points to Win" setting. In rounds mode, the complete set of configured rounds.
- **Match**: In points mode, multiple games played until one team reaches the "Matches to Win" setting. When a match is won, confetti celebrates the victory!

### Hammer System
The hammer (🔨) indicates which team shoots last in each round:
- Enable/disable in Settings with "Show Hammer" checkbox
- Automatically alternates after each completed round (2-0 or 1-1)
- When starting a new match, choose which team starts first
- The team that shoots first does NOT have the hammer

### 20s Tracking (Center Shots)
When enabled, after each completed round you'll be prompted to enter center shots (20-point):
- **Calculator Interface**: Quick number buttons for fast entry
- **Sequential Input**: Enter one team at a time for speed
- **Auto-Advance**: Automatically proceeds after each team's entry
- **Dynamic Max**: Shows 0-8 buttons for Individual games, 0-12 for Parejas (doubles)
- Button 0 spans full width for quick "no 20s" entry

### Resetting Games
- **New Game** (Points Mode only): Clears points and resets timer (keeps games won counter, hammer alternates for next game)
- **New Match**: Full reset of all counters and stats, always prompts for new hammer selection
- **Switch Sides**: Swaps team positions on screen
- **Switch Colors**: Exchanges team colors only

**Notes**:
- In rounds mode, "New Game" is hidden from the quick menu (only "New Match" available)
- When a match is won, only "New Match" is available to start a new match
- Scoring is automatically blocked once all rounds are completed in rounds mode
